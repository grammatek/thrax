Thrax is a toolkit for compiling grammars based on regular expressions and
context-dependent rewrite rules into weighted finite-state transducers
(FSTs). The FST representation uses OpenFst.

REQUIREMENTS:
  This version is known to work under Linux using g++ (>= 8) and OS X using
  XCode (>= 9). It is expected to work wherever adequate POSIX (dlopen,
  ssize_t, basename), c99 (snprintf, strtoll, <stdint.h>), and C++17
  ((ordered_set>, ordered_map>, <forward_list>, constexpr-if) support
  is available. It assumes you have installed OpenFst (www.openfst.org)
  configured with the --enable-grm flag.

INSTALLATION:
  Follow the generic GNU build system instructions in ./INSTALL. We
  recommend configuring with =--enable-static=no= for faster compiles.

  Configuring with --enable-bin=no excludes the command line utilities (not
  generally useful).

  Configuring with --enable-readline enables readline (in-line editing) for
  thraxrewrite-tester. You must have GNU readline installed.

  Compiling with '-Wall -Wno-sign-compare' under g++ should give no
  warnings from this library.

USAGE:
  Assuming you've installed under the default /usr/local, the GRM binaries are
  found on /usr/local/bin. Headers will be in /usr/local/include/thrax, and
  libraries in /usr/local/lib.

  Auxiliary data files -- provided grammars -- are under /usr/local/share/thrax.
  Syntax highlighters (for vi and emacs) and other useful tools are under
  /usr/local/share/utils.

  To use in your own programs you will need to include <thrax/thrax.h>. Compile
  with '-I /usr/local/include' and link against /usr/local/lib/libfst.so,
  /usr/local/lib/fst/libfstfar.so and /usr/local/lib/libthrax.so

  The linking is, by default, dynamic so that the Fst and Arc type DSO
  extensions can be used correctly if desired.

DOCUMENTATION:
  See www.opengrm.org for general documentation.
  See ./NEWS for updates since the last release.


BUILDING FOR ANDROID

  This branch has the changes necessary to compile Thrax for all Android platforms.

  The file build-android.sh is used to call configure / make / make install with the right options.
  One can/should set a few environment variables to influence build assumptions in
  build-android.sh.

  These variables are ANDROID_NDK, ANDROID_NDK_TOOLCHAIN, ANDROID_API, PREFIX. Pleased read
  the file build-android.sh carefully, how these are used and adapt them to your needs.

  You need to have an accompanying OpenFst installed with the correct platform
  inside your installation path. Refer to https://github.com/grammatek/openfst/tree/android.
  The currently used OpenFST version is 1.8.1

  Finally, call ./build-android.sh to configure/make/make install Thrax.
